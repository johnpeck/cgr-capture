* cgrlib progress
* ---------------------------- Dated notes -----------------------------
* <2013-11-17 Sun> Created this document
* ----------------------------- TODO list ------------------------------
* setup.py script
** DONE Check to see if dependencies actually get updated
   - They do!  You just don't see all the output from the setup.py script.
** DONE Restructure project to have a tools directory
   - The tools directory will have the cgr-capture and cgr-cal
     scripts.  This will allow me to struture the project like
     pelican, and use the console scripts method to create
     executables.
** TODO Store the version number in a better way
   - I need to be able to print out the version number on the command line.
   - The fix may be here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/458550/standard-way-to-embed-version-into-python-package
* cgr-capture script
** DONE Write plotinit() function
   - Configures the plot, returns the plot object (gplot)
** DONE gplot object needs to be created in the main loop
   - This keeps the plot from being destroyed until the program is
     done.  This allows plotting the result of each average without
     destroying the plot.
** DONE What happens if cgr-capture is run from whatever directory?
   - Seems like I need to have a search routine for the config file.
   - Nice!  The script creates a default config file from wherever the
     script was called from!  This is exactly what I want!
** DONE Create savedata function
   - Unfortunately, the datafile will need to have a lot of metadata
     in it.  The saveddata function needs to take the config object as
     an argument, since I'll be specifying the save file name in
     there.
** DONE Calibration factor dates must be checked when used
   - If the dates are 'none' or more than a year apart, a warning
     should be raised.  See the caldict_default dictionary in utils.py
     for a list of all calibration factors and their associated dates.
   - I started doing this with get_cal_data() from utils.py.  This
     needs to be extended to the remaining calibration factors.
** TODO There should be a file to keep last port
   - Should have the last port connected to.  This could be something
     like cgr-session.pkl.
** TODO Custom serial port list should be added to the config
** DONE Cal file should be set in the config file
** TODO Save data function should write timestamp to file
** TODO I should just be able to call cgr-capture
   - Take a look at what pelican does to set this up.
** DONE One command-line argument should be init file
   - The default should be cgr-capture.cfg, but it should accept
     alternates.
** DONE Check to see that averaging works
* cgr-cal script
** TODO What is this output file?  
** DONE Add support for averaging while measuring slopes
** DONE Add makefile to automate install and reindent steps
   - This will give me a place to write comments about the reindent
     and installation scripts.  As long as the makefile isn't in the
     manifest, it won't be added to the package.
** TODO Add checks for slope and offset values
   - Offset counts should be within 10 counts of zero, and offsets
     should be within 10% of 45mV / count.  Fail the calibration and
     don't write any calibration factors if this happens.
** DONE Add way to escape offset calibration
** DONE Config file should specify which voltage to ask for
** DONE Calibration dates need to be added to caldict
   - caldict members _caldate should be added for each calibration
     coefficient.  For example, since there's a chA_1x_offset member,
     there should be a chA_1x_offset_caldate member.  If the member
     has never been calibrated, the caldate should be 'none'.  When
     the calibration coefficient is used, there should be a warning
     that the coefficient has never been updated from its default
     value.
** TODO There should be a file to keep last port
   - Should have the last port connected to.  This could be something
     like cgr-session.pkl.
** TODO Custom serial port list should be added to config
** DONE cal file should be set in config file
   - Right now it's specified in the utils.py file.  Its name is cgrcal.pkl.
** DONE utils.load_cal() should take a filename
** DONE trigdict needs to be set manually for calibration
   - Trigger source needs to be manual, and points needs to be set to
     whatever -- 500.  This should be pulled out of the configuration
     file.
** DONE get_offsets function should just get offsets specified by cfg
   - Right now the function runs through both gain settings.  I think
     a better way is to only use the gain setting set in the config
     file.  
* readme file
** TODO Document how to fix gnuplot script
