* <2013-11-17 Sun> Created this document
* ----------------------------- TODO list ------------------------------
* cgr-cal script
** TODO There should be a file to keep last port
   - Should have the last port connected to.  This could be something
     like cgr-session.pkl.
** TODO Custom serial port list should be added to config
** DONE cal file should be set in config file
   - Right now it's specified in the utils.py file.  Its name is cgrcal.pkl.
** DONE utils.load_cal() should take a filename
** DONE trigdict needs to be set manually for calibration
   - Trigger source needs to be manual, and points needs to be set to
     whatever -- 500.  This should be pulled out of the configuration
     file.
** TODO get_offsets function should just get offsets specified by cfg
   - Right now the function runs through both gain settings.  I think
     a better way is to only use the gain setting set in the config
     file.  
** TODO Config file should specify which voltage to ask for
* cgr-capture script
** TODO There should be a file to keep last port
   - Should have the last port connected to.  This could be something
     like cgr-session.pkl.
** TODO Custom serial port list should be added to the config
** DONE Cal file should be set in the config file
** DONE One command-line argument should be init file
   - The default should be cgr-capture.cfg, but it should accept
     alternates.
** DONE Check to see that averaging works
