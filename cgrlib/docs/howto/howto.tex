% Uses the multicol package.  
% Don't try to use column separators (lines) -- there's still something
% strange going on with column widths.
%
% printindex still takes two arguments:
% 1. The ind file containing the index entries
% 2. The name for the index (will appear in the table of contents and at the
%    top of the index page.
