oscilloscope from
[Syscomp Electronic Design](http://www.syscompdesign.com).

## Installation ##

(as root) python setup.py install

## Setting up Gnuplot for plotting ##

What simple graphics this software has is handled by
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info) via
[gnuplot-py](http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/doc).  Gnuplot-py is
available from [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gnuplot-py), and
thus can be installed with

`pip install gnuplot-py`

where [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest) is a nice package
installer.
